# Browzwear Memory Game Assignment

In this assignment you are requested to finish implementing a memory game app in React. Most of the game is already written, you only have to implement several methods and design the app as in the mockups.

You can also add your own code and change the existing one. What's important is the use of React, and understanding the app logic and structure.

If you're not sure what are the rules of the game, here's a [reminder](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)#Rules>)

Good luck!
